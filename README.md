This repo is intended as a Sandbox for experimenting with developing a Progressive Web App, or PWA. It is a fork of an existing ['hello world' repo by jamesjohnson280](https://github.com/jamesjohnson280/hello-pwa)

PWA is a term that describes a set of browser features that allows a website to function offline.

## What It Is

A simple PWA demo that displays the text "Hello, World!" utilizing an app manifest, service workers and caching. This demo is written in plain-vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript (ES6). It has no dependencies.

I've also written a tutorial to go along with the code. Read it on Medium:
